# Paint-Hit

Other than the first commit i did everything.
I know the level system and circle system is hardcoded and game is too easy(which is mostly the "instructor" 's mistake). Im moving to other courses-projects for now.
When i decide to come back to this project, im going to fix circle and level system and this line will dissapear :)
